# ✅ Almost Done! One Final Step

I've done everything I can:
- ✅ Git initialized
- ✅ All files committed
- ✅ Ready to push

## Now You Just Need To:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (30 seconds)

1. **Open this link:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `aicv-troy-knott-profile` (or any name)
3. **Make it Public or Private** (your choice)
4. **DO NOT check "Initialize with README"**
5. **Click "Create repository"**
6. **Copy the repository URL** from the page (looks like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aicv-troy-knott-profile.git`)

### Step 2: Tell Me The URL

Once you have the GitHub repository URL, I can push the code for you!

**Or if you want to do it yourself:**

After creating the repo, run this command in Cursor's terminal:
```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/new
2. **Click "Import Git Repository"**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Click "Deploy"**

That's it! Your site will be live in 2 minutes.

**Everything is ready - I just need that GitHub repository URL from you!**
