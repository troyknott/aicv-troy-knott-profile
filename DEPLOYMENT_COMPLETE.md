# ✅ Code Pushed to GitHub Successfully!

## What's Done:
✅ **GitHub Authentication** - Complete
✅ **Code Pushed** - All files are on GitHub
✅ **Repository:** https://github.com/troyknott/aicv-troy-knott-profile

## Next: Deploy to Vercel

Since Node.js installation may take a few minutes, here are two options:

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Fastest - 2 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/new
2. **Click:** "Import Git Repository"
3. **Select:** `troyknott/aicv-troy-knott-profile`
4. **Click:** "Deploy"
5. **Add Environment Variable:**
   - Key: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
   - Value: Your Vercel URL (shown after deploy, e.g., `https://aicv-troy-knott-profile.vercel.app`)
6. **Redeploy** after adding the variable

### Option 2: Wait for Node.js Installation, Then Use CLI

I'm installing Node.js now. Once it's done, I'll:
1. Install Vercel CLI
2. Authenticate with Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

**Your code is live on GitHub! You can deploy to Vercel right now via the dashboard, or wait for me to finish the CLI setup.**
