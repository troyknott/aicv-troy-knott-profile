# ⚠️ Authentication Required

I cannot authenticate to GitHub or Vercel on your behalf for security reasons. However, I've prepared everything for you to deploy in **2 minutes**:

## Fastest Method: Use Cursor's UI (No Terminal Needed)

### In Cursor (Right Now):

1. **Click Source Control icon** (left sidebar - Git branch icon)
2. **Click "Initialize Repository"** (if shown)
3. **Click "+" next to each file** OR click **"Stage All Changes"**
4. **Type commit message:** `Initial commit`
5. **Click "Commit"**
6. **Click "Publish to GitHub"** button (top of panel)
7. **Sign in to GitHub** when prompted (Cursor will open browser)
8. **Create new repository** or select existing
9. **Click "Publish"**

### Then in Browser:

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/new
2. **Click "Import Git Repository"**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Click "Deploy"** (Vercel auto-detects everything)
5. **Add environment variable:**
   - Key: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
   - Value: Your Vercel URL (shown after deploy)
6. **Redeploy**

**That's it!** Your site will be live in ~3 minutes.
