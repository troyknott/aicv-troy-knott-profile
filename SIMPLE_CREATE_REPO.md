# Create GitHub Repo - 2 Clicks

I can't create the repository without your GitHub login, but here's the **fastest way**:

## Option 1: Web Interface (30 seconds)

1. **Click this link:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `aicv-troy-knott-profile`
3. **Leave everything else as default**
4. **Click "Create repository"** (green button)
5. **Copy the URL** from the page
6. **Come back here and tell me the URL** - I'll push the code immediately!

## Option 2: Install GitHub CLI (Then I Can Do It)

If you install GitHub CLI, I can create the repo for you automatically:

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

Then I can run the script that creates everything!

**The fastest path right now:**
1. Click: https://github.com/new
2. Name: `aicv-troy-knott-profile`
3. Click "Create repository"
4. Give me the URL
5. I'll push everything!

Everything is already committed and ready to push. Just need that repository URL!
